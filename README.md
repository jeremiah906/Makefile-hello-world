# Hello-C-and-Makefile
A hello world program written in C for me to practice writing GNU Makefile

## Getting started
1. Do the git clone on this repository.
2. Run `make` to build an executable **hello** file and its associated compiled files.
3. Run `./hello` to print a simple random number plus a hello world word.

## Removing compiled files
Run `make clean` to remove all compiled .o files

Run `make distclean` to remove all compiled .o files including the executable **hello** file.
